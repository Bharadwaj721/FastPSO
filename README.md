# FastPSO: A Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm



## 🧠 What is FastPSO?

**FastPSO** is a modified version of the classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, created as part of an academic exploration during the 2nd year of B.Tech. It focuses on accelerating convergence — making the search “fast enough” while still keeping solutions “good enough.”

This project introduces **four simple but impactful modifications** to the original PSO, aimed at improving search efficiency in low to mid-dimensional spaces.

## 🎯 Motivation

Heuristics and metaheuristics aim for “good enough solutions in a fast enough manner.”  
FastPSO focuses on improving the **fast** part without losing the **good**.

## 🔍 Key Modifications Over Standard PSO

1. **Uniform Initialization of Positions**
   - Divides the search space into `n` blocks and initializes one particle per block.
   - Ensures better initial coverage of the space.

2. **Non-Zero Initial Velocities**
   - Particles start with small initial velocity instead of zero to enable faster movement from the beginning.

3. **Forced Movement of One Particle to Gbest**
   - In each iteration, a randomly chosen particle is moved directly to the current global best to speed up convergence.

4. **Position Update Only if Fitness is No Worse**
   - A position is updated only if the new fitness is equal to or better than the current one.

## 🧪 Test Function (1D Example)

The algorithm has been initially tested on the following function:

```math
f(x) = -x^2 + 10x + 20 \quad \text{where } x \in [-10, 10]
```

⚠️ Note: This is an early prototype and not yet benchmarked on large-scale functions.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Benchmark FastPSO on standard test functions (Rastrigin, Ackley, Rosenbrock, etc.)
- Extend to multi-dimensional search spaces.
- Analyze convergence trends over time.
